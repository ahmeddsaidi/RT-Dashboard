# RT-Dashboard  
A robust data pipeline and visualization system using a powerful tech stack: **Apache Kafka**, **Zookeeper**, **Apache Spark**, **Plotly/Dash**, and **Docker**.  

This project fetches real-time IBM stock prices (OHLCV - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume), processes the data, and visualizes it in an interactive dashboard.

## 📸 **Project Overview**  

### **1. Architecture Diagram**  
![Architecture](Images/architecture.png)  
*The high-level architecture of the project. Data flows from Kafka (for real-time streaming) to Spark (for processing) and finally to Plotly/Dash for visualization. Zookeeper ensures Kafka's coordination, and Docker containerizes the entire system.*

### **2. Dashboard - Real-Time Stock Prices**  
![Dashboard](Images/img1.png)  
*The main dashboard showing real-time IBM stock prices. The OHLCV data is updated dynamically as new data streams in.*

### **3. Dashboard - OHCLV Analysis**  
![Historical Trends](Images/img2.png)  
*A view of historical stock price trends, allowing users to analyze patterns over time.*
